Artificial intelligence, or AI for short, is the science and engineering of making machines that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as understanding language, recognizing images, playing games, solving problems and learning from data. AI is one of the most exciting and rapidly evolving fields of computer science, and it has many applications in various domains, such as healthcare, entertainment, education, business, security and more.

But what does AI have to do with B.Tech? Well, B.Tech is a four-year undergraduate degree program that offers various specializations in engineering and technology. One of these specializations is artificial intelligence and machine learning, or AI & ML for short. This is a sub-domain of computer science that covers both artificial learning and machine learning courses. Artificial learning is the process of creating smart machines that can learn from data and experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning is a branch of artificial learning that focuses on creating algorithms and models that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions.

So, if you choose to pursue B.Tech in AI & ML, you will learn how to design, develop and implement intelligent systems that can interact with humans and the environment. You will also learn how to use various programming languages, such as Prolog, Lisp, Java and Python, to write code for these systems. You will also study mathematics and physics in modular forms during your first few semesters, and then move on to core subjects of AI, such as natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, neural networks, deep learning and more.

Sounds cool, right? But wait, there's more! B.Tech in AI & ML also offers many benefits for your career and future prospects. For one thing, AI is one of the most in-demand skills in the world today, and there is a huge gap between the supply and demand of AI professionals. According to a report by NASSCOM, India alone will need 2.3 million AI professionals by 2025. That means there are plenty of opportunities for you to land a lucrative job in this field after completing your degree. Some of the top companies that hire AI graduates are Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Cognizant, TCS and Reliance Jio.

Another benefit of B.Tech in AI & ML is that it opens up many avenues for higher education and research. If you are interested in pursuing further studies in this field, you can opt for M.Tech or PhD programs in reputed institutes like IITs or NITs. You can also apply for scholarships or fellowships to study abroad in countries like USA, UK or Canada. You can also join research labs or organizations that are working on cutting-edge projects in AI.

So, as you can see, B.Tech in AI & ML is a very useful and rewarding course that can help you achieve your dreams and goals. But before you enroll in this course, you need to fulfill some eligibility criteria and clear some entrance exams. The basic eligibility criteria for B.Tech in AI & ML is that you should have passed 10+2 or equivalent from a recognized board with science stream as mandatory. You should also have scored at least 60% marks in aggregate with mathematics and physics as compulsory subjects.

The entrance exams for B.Tech in AI & ML vary depending on the institute you want to join. Some of the top entrance exams are JEE Main, JEE Advanced, BITSAT, VITEEE and SRMJEEE. You need to prepare well for these exams by solving previous year papers, taking mock tests and revising the syllabus thoroughly. You also need to check the cut-off marks and rank lists of different colleges to know your chances of getting admission.
